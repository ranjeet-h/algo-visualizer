# Algo-Visualized

An interactive platform to visualize and understand data structures and algorithms, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## 🌟 Features

### Data Structures Visualizations
- **Arrays**: Visualize array operations and manipulations
- **Linked Lists**: Interactive visualizations for singly, doubly, and circular linked lists
- **Stacks & Queues**: Visualize stack, queue, and deque operations
- **Hash Tables**: Explore hash maps and hash sets with collision resolution
- **Trees**: Visualize binary trees and tree operations

### Algorithm Visualizations
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
- More algorithms coming soon!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algo-visualized.git
cd algo-visualized
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🛠️ Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type safety
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool and development server
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - Data visualization library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - Unstyled, accessible UI components

## 🎯 Usage

1. Select a data structure or algorithm from the sidebar menu
2. Interact with the visualization using the control panel
3. Observe how the data structure or algorithm behaves with different inputs and operations

## 📚 Learning Resources

Each visualization includes:
- Brief explanation of the data structure or algorithm
- Time and space complexity information
- Interactive controls to see operations in action
- Step-by-step visualization of processes

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
- Advanced data structures (AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, etc.)
- Path-finding algorithms
- Dynamic programming visualizations
- User accounts to save custom configurations
